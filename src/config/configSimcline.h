//------------ SET THESE TWO VALUES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MECHANICAL RANGE LIMITATIONS OF YOUR SIMCLINE !!! -------------
// Raw Grade Value Minimally (Mechanically: the lowest position of wheel axis)  19000 is equiv. of 10% downhill road grade
#define RGVMIN 19500 // -5%  // Always is RGVMIN < 20000 (flat road level)
// Raw Grade Value Maximally (Mechanically: the highest position of wheel axis) 22000 is equiv. of 20% uphill road grade
#define RGVMAX 22000 // 20%  // +20% // Always is RGVMAX > 20000 (flat road level)

// The following VL6180X sensor values are a 100% construction specific and
// should be experimentally determined, when the Actuator AND the VL6180X sensor are mounted!
// ------>>>> Test manually and use example/test sketches that go with the VL6180X sensor! <<<<---
// Microswitches should limit physically/mechanically the upper and lower position of the Actuator!
// The microswitches are mechanically controlled, and NOT by the software --> should be fail safe!
// Notice that unrestricted movement at the boundaries can damage the Actuator and/or construction!
// The following values are respected by the software and will (in normal cases!) never be exceeded!
#define MINPOSITION 10  // VL6180X highest value top microswitch activated to mechanically stop operation
#define MAXPOSITION 195 // VL6180X lowest value bottom microswitch activated to mechanically stop operation

// -------------------------- WARNING ------------------------------------------------------------
// Operational boundaries of the VL6180X sensor are used/set in class Lifter after calling its "init".
// A safe measuring range of at least 30 cm of total movement is recommended for the VL6180X sensor setting!
//
// Bandwidth is used in the code to take measuring errors and a safe margin into account when reaching
// the above defined max or min positions of the construction! The software does painstakingly respect
// these and is independent of the appropriate working of the microswitches when reaching the boundaries!
// These microswitches are a SECOND line of defence against out of range and potentially damaging movement!
